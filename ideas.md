Just a list of basic ideas.

* create a script that can check gmail for emails from/to a 
specific address (maybe even check the subject line for a
word or clue) and then sync the email history to the contact
record in infusionsoft.

* create a script that can check gmail for emails BCC address
and upload email appropriately. 

* make a self hostable script that gets all users and their tasks,
then emails the users a list of their daily tasks.

* make a sample orderform that posts to the same location that
the regular shopping cart or order form posts to. 

* create browser plugin that can scrape a webform report and then
scrape all of the submissions from the report and provide the data
in a nice csv file. (Eventually a pretty report)

* write mobile app that is browser only for the users forms
and cart.  Write browser wide stylesheet that overwrites the
forms stylesheet so that users can have mobile styling.
